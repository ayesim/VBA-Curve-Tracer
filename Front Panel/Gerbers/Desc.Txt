There is a 10mil line width board outline on each gerber layer.
The *.GKO has the board outline and 2 rectangular cutouts. These
are supposed to be holes within the border of the PCB.
There is art work on the PCB. It looks like 2 birds facing.
each other. It violates several rules. It doesn't matter if this
turns out. It is not in the circuit.

Make sure you order the black color!!!
