There is a 10mil line width board outline on each gerber layer.
The *.GKO has the board outline, 2 rectagular cutouts and
3 D shaped cutouts. These 5 cutouts are within the border and
should be holes in the PCB. 
There is art work on the PCB. It looks like 2 birds facing.
each other. It violates several rules. It doesn't matter if this
turns out. It is not in the circuit.
