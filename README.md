# Curve-Tracer
This is a repository to hold files related to my Curve Tracer project

There are three different Blogs that I created for this project.
The original posting with a description of the Theory of Operation for the CT and the building of my version.
This blog can be found here: http://www.paulvdiyblogs.net/2017/12/building-curve-tracer.html

A few years later, PCB layout has been developed using mostly SMD parts. This Blog can be found here:
