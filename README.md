# VBA Curve Tracer
This is a repository to hold all files related to the VBA Curve Tracer project

There are three different Blogs that I created for this project.
The original posting with a description of the Theory of Operation for the CT and the building of my version.
This blog can be found here: http://www.paulvdiyblogs.net/2017/12/building-curve-tracer.html

A few years later, a PCB layout has been developed using mostly SMD parts. The Blog that covers the Version 2 can be found here:

The development of the VBA Curve Tracer (Version 3 in the series) can be found here:

Finally, I created a blog post with several measurments that were made with the VBA Curve Tracer.
