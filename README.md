# VBA Curve Tracer

"Design is easy, production is hell"

At this moment, we're finding out what this means. While going through the process of having PCBWAY produce the Main board, to test the process, we are finding several issues with our BOM due to part end-of-life, availability, prices and some hard to get resistor values. We're now in the process of fine tuning the BOM together. Once we have the Main board in production, we'll start this process on the Front board. The production by PCBWAY will only be for SMD parts, so this requires special BOM's and Pick&Place files.
We are also updating the schematics and layouts with these changes. Do not order the boards just yet. I'll let you know when we're done. 

The Main board files are now updated and the board is in production with SMD added. We're now finding that the main capacitor of 2200uF/250V is hard to get so we're going to add a 4-pin alternative to the layout.
Stay tuned.

This is a repository to hold all files related to the VBA Curve Tracer project. With this information you can build one yourself.
Note that newer versions of files will overwrite the existing ones, there will be no version control. Look at the upload dates for more information.

There are four different Blogs that I created for this project.
The original posting with a description of the Theory of Operation for the CT and the building of my first version, a working prototype.

A few years later, a PCB layout has been developed using mostly SMD parts by Mark Allie. The Blog that covers the Version 2 can be found here:

Some of the development process of the VBA Curve Tracer (Version 3) with the help from Mark Allie and Bud Bennet can be found here:

The information about the final instrument for a DIY build can be found here:

I also created a blog post with several measurements that were made with the VBA Curve Tracer.
