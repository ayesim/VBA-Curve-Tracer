# VBA Curve Tracer
This is a repository to hold all files related to the VBA Curve Tracer project. With this information you can build one yourself.
Note that newer versions of files will overwrite the existing ones, there will be no version control. Look at the upload dates for more information.

There are four different Blogs that I created for this project.
The original posting with a description of the Theory of Operation for the CT and the building of my first version, a working prototype.

A few years later, a PCB layout has been developed using mostly SMD parts by Mark Allie. The Blog that covers the Version 2 can be found here:

Some of the development process of the VBA Curve Tracer (Version 3) with the help from Mark Allie and Bud Bennet can be found here:

I also created a blog post with several measurements that were made with the VBA Curve Tracer.
