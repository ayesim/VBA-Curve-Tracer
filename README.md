# VBA Curve Tracer
This is a repository to hold all files related to the VBA Curve Tracer project

There are four different Blogs that I created for this project.
The original posting with a description of the Theory of Operation for the CT and the building of my first version, a working prototype.

A few years later, a PCB layout has been developed using mostly SMD parts. The Blog that covers the Version 2 can be found here:

The development of the VBA Curve Tracer (Version 3) can be found here:
